    <td class="tg-031e" colspan="2">App Description: Recognizing the entrepreneurial spirit amongst UMD students, this app provides a dynamic platform for marketing and growing their unique businesses, from quick
      sew fixes to eyebrow threading. Simultaneously, it addresses a significant disconnect,
      connecting students who require these services but lack transportation to these budding
      enterprises. This app would ideally offers students an easy, walkable access to on-campus
      services. They would be able to browse, review, and book services based on their needs,
      ensuring convenience and safety.
      For the student business owners, the app offers an expanded customer base, fostering
      their growth and providing an additional revenue stream. By creating this bridge, we are not only
      supporting these small businesses but also enriching our community. It's an opportunity to
      redefine the UMD college experience by fostering an ecosystem where entrepreneurship thrives
      and every student's needs are met right within campus confines.
