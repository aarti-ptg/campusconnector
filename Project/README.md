## Campus Connector

## Description

Recognizing the entrepreneurial spirit amongst UMD students, I aim to develop an app
that provides a dynamic platform for marketing and growing their unique businesses, from quick
sew fixes to eyebrow threading. Simultaneously, it addresses a significant disconnect,
connecting students who require these services but lack transportation to these budding
enterprises. This app would ideally offers students an easy, walkable access to on-campus
services. They would be able to browse, review, and book services based on their needs,
ensuring convenience and safety.

For the student business owners, the app offers an expanded customer base, fostering
their growth and providing an additional revenue stream. By creating this bridge, we are not only
supporting these small businesses but also enriching our community. It's an opportunity to
redefine the UMD college experience by fostering an ecosystem where entrepreneurship thrives
and every student's needs are met right within campus confines.
