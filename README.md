# UMD Campus Services App Development Journey

## Introduction

Over the past three months, I embarked on an ambitious journey to develop an application from scratch at the University of Maryland (UMD). With no prior knowledge in Database Design, PHP, Kotlin, SQL, and app development, my passion for creating an application to serve UMD students fueled this journey. The goal was to create a platform for students to market and grow their businesses, addressing a unique need within the university community.

## Background/Literature Review

### Comparative Analysis with Existing Platforms

TaskRabbit and Craigslist are two prominent platforms in the domain of service promotion and provision. TaskRabbit is a mobile and online marketplace that matches freelance labor with local demand, allowing consumers to find immediate help with everyday tasks, including cleaning, moving, and handyman work. Craigslist is a vast online classified ads website, where people can find a variety of services, buy and sell items, and seek housing.

However, these platforms have a broad focus and are not tailored to the unique dynamics of a university campus. They cater to a general audience and do not specifically address the challenges faced by college students, such as limited transportation options and the need for convenient access to services within walking distance.

### Identifying the Campus-Specific Needs

My research led to the realization that there is a gap in the market for a platform specifically designed for the university environment. College students often face transportation constraints, making it difficult for them to access services off-campus. Therefore, there's a need for a solution that facilitates easy, walkable access to services offered within the confines of their campus.

## Plan of Study

### Initial Concept

The app was conceptualized to bridge the gap between student business owners seeking to expand their customer base and students in need of services but lacking convenient transportation options. The primary goal was to offer a range of on-campus services such as quick sew fixes and eyebrow threading directly within students' reach.

## Skill Development

This project significantly expanded my knowledge in programming languages, UI design, and database management. It also instilled in me the ability to implement design thinking in real-world scenarios.

## Reflection and Learning

This journey was not just about developing an app but also about personal and professional growth. While the initial lack of knowledge in critical areas posed a significant challenge, the support from my mentor and the rigorous academic curriculum provided a strong foundation for learning and development. The process taught me the importance of perseverance, strategic planning, and adaptability.

Despite setbacks in areas like UI development, the project was a testament to the power of determination and the value of hands-on learning. The app now stands as a symbol of bridging gaps within the UMD community and fostering an environment where entrepreneurship and student needs coexist harmoniously.

As I conclude this report, I am not just presenting a completed project but sharing a significant chapter of my academic and personal growth story. This journey at UMD has been enriching and transformative, shaping me into a more competent and confident individual ready to tackle future challenges in the tech world.
